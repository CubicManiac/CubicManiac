This program visualizes the path finding algorithm called A*

To run the program, the user first selects start and end points, represented by orange and blue, respectively.

Then, using the mouse, the user can create obstacles between the start and end points. The obstacles are represented by black color.

After completing the obstacles, the user can press the space bar to start the algorithm.

When a suitable path is found by the algorithm, the path is represented by purple color.

The user can press 'c' at any time during the program runtime, except when the path finding algorithm starts, to clear the screen and start again.
