In this program user is given a set of n jobs J_1, J_2,
J_3, ... J_n. The program automaically accepts or rejects
a job with a probability of 0.5.
If jobs are accepted they are first sorted in ascending
order the then time is calculated for each job. The
 program at any point of time, works on at most one job.
If job is rejected the the user has to pay a rejection 
cost associate with the job.

After all jobs are completed objective for that program
run is printed, which is the addition of "total 
completion time" and "total rejection cost",


The program is created such that the objective is
minimized.
